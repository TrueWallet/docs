## Decentralization
We prefer the blockchain way, which brings us decentralization, transparency, openness, and anonymity. So, we are trying to follow it where it can be possible. 

The project provides a centralized API service, but its main goal is to simplify some staff and it is optional to use.

TrueWallet is a non-custodial solution. It doesn't store any private keys and provides solutions to eliminate private key storing for other projects or their users where it can.
